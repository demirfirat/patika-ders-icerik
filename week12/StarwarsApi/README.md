## Project Overview 
Listing starships by taking data from https://swapi.dev/, the Star Wars API. We made progress by increasing the requests for all starships on the API with the more button. A dynamic site and environment was prepared for users to easily navigate between starships.

## Features
- **Search Bar**: Find starships listed on the screen with the search bar.
- **Clickable list**: By clicking on the listed items, an environment was created to get more information about the item.
- **Show More**: It was aimed to provide more and dynamic information flow to users by adding the items in the list to the listed items with the more button.
- **Ship Detail**: A functional environment has been prepared with more information about that data in each clicked starship and a button to return to the main screen.
## Technologies Used
- **CSS3**: To style the website and create a responsive design.
- **React.js - Vite**: It is a modern JavaScript build tool that provides out-of-the-box support for common web patterns, offering optimised builds with the flexibility and maturity of rollup, combined with a fast, package-free development server made possible by esbuild and native ES modules. By using this tool, a more dynamic website interface was made by supporting internal components with a component structure.
- **React Router Dom**: By using React Router DOM, it was aimed to improve the user experience in single page applications (SPA) and to enable switching between different components without the need for page refresh. That is, it was implemented to dynamically change certain components of the application based on URL changes.
