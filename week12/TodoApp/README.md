## Features
- **To-do add bar**: To add an item to the list, just type and press enter.
- **Clear completed and completed button**: A button to delete the added and marked tasks completely and a separate button to see what has been done.
- **Delete and Active**: An easy user friendly interface is aimed with the delete or show active buttons.

## Technologies Used
- **CSS3**: To style the website and create a responsive design.
- **React.js - Vite**: It is a modern JavaScript build tool that provides out-of-the-box support for common web patterns, offering optimised builds with the flexibility and maturity of rollup, combined with a fast, package-free development server made possible by esbuild and native ES modules.
- **React Context API**: React Context API was used to reduce the need for ‘prop drilling’ in the component tree. Context allows to share a data globally across the whole application or in a specific part of it.
